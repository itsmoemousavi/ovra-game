# Ovra: project notes for Claude

Read this first. It carries the context of the earlier (cloud) sessions: what the game is,
how we work, what the owner decided, and what is still open. Details live in
`docs/DESIGN.md` (design + balance numbers), `docs/3D-PLAN.md` (3D notes) and `README.md` (controls).

## The game

Mobile 3v3 lane-strategy game in the spirit of Dota 2 (original names and art, no Dota assets).
Name: **Ovra** (an invented word with no meaning, like "Dota"; was Shrinefall, then briefly Emberwake, renamed 2026-11-04
because Emberwake was taken). Icon: a weathered round stone tower split blue/red by a glowing ember crack, team banners, a brazier fire, at night
(3D, owner approved 2026-11-11; sculpted in `src/devtools/icon-art.ts`, open `/icon-art.html`, `window.iconPng(size)`;
PNGs in `public/`, 1024 px store version in `docs/icon-1024.png`). They rejected a toy-like brick tower and gold emblems.
Destroy towers → barracks → shrine towers → the enemy **Shrine**. Empty slots are bots.
Offline vs bots for now; multiplayer and app-store release later (Capacitor planned).

- **Always landscape** (on a phone held upright the whole UI is rotated, `src/client/screen.ts`).
  The owner plays with rotation lock ON (iPhone 16 Pro: game area about 793 × 393), so the page is really portrait. CSS must use `cqw`/`cqh`, `@container` and `--sl/--sr/--st/--sb`, never `vw`/`vh`/`@media` size queries/`env()` directly. Test layout at viewport 393 × 793, not only landscape: Chrome's responsive view doesn't show this case. iOS shows the status bar in portrait, so with rotation lock on only the real app can hide it.
- The owner tests on an **iPhone** through the GitHub Pages build: https://itsmoemousavi.github.io/ovra-game/
  Settings → Graphics shows `build <sha>`: ask them to check it (Safari caches old builds).
- **3D is the default view** (Three.js); 2D stays as a "low graphics" setting and as the fallback
  if WebGL fails (the reason is shown in a toast and under Settings → Graphics).

## Workflow

- Work on branch `claude/dota-like-game-design-slf3o9`. `main` is the public showcase branch (README, patch notes,
  playable with `npm install && npm run dev`; the repo's default branch); it was brought up to date on 2026-11-04 (v0.10.0).
  On `main` the workflow only tests + builds (Pages may only deploy from the dev branch); keep `main` in sync by
  fast-forward pushes when the owner asks.
  Don't push to other branches or merge into `main` without being asked.
- **Patch notes:** every change gets an entry in `CHANGELOG.md` (newest first, plain player-facing language) and the
  matching `version` in `package.json` (shown in Settings). Last number = each change, middle number = milestone.
  Internal-only changes go in as "Behind the scenes". Never write "Dota" in README/CHANGELOG (public).
- Every push to the branch runs tests + build and deploys Pages (`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`).
  **If any test fails or the runner errors, the site does not update**: check the Actions run after pushing.
- Commit messages: plain English, what changed and why. Never put model names in commits/PRs.
- The owner wants short, plain-language updates (they are not a programmer): what changed,
  what to test on the phone, what is still open. Ask before big direction changes.

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run dev                      # local dev server (phone on same Wi-Fi: use the printed network URL)
npm test                         # vitest (sim unit tests + full bot matches; ~2 min)
npm run build
npx tsc --noEmit
npx vite-node scripts/simulate.ts [seed] [minutes]           # headless all-bot match log
npx vite-node scripts/hero-winrates.ts [firstSeed] [matches] # random 3v3 bot lineups → win % per hero
npx vite-node scripts/map-check.ts [firstSeed] [matches] > out.jsonl  # per-match JSON: winner, heroes+items, buildings fallen, stuck heroes
# Animation close-ups (dev only): npm run dev, open /anim-preview.html, then in the console
#   run('syl', 'attack', 0.1, 'front')  /  run('orin', 'cast', 0.8, 'game', 2)  /  area('maelstrom', 1.5)
python3 scripts/tune-hero.py 'vexa.baseDamage=35' 'brakk.ironHide.block=[5, 8, 11, 14]'   # edit hero numbers
```

Run several `hero-winrates.ts` processes in parallel with different seeds (e.g. 12 × 6 matches) for balance checks;
with ~100 matches a hero's win rate still swings about ±5% from luck.

## Code map

- The sim must use `dSin/dCos/dAtan2/dHypot` from `sim/math.ts`, never `Math.sin` etc, and nothing random outside its `Rng`: multiplayer runs the same match on every device (Chrome and Safari engines compared identical). World changes must go through commands.

- `src/sim/` deterministic 30 Hz simulation, no DOM. Commands pattern (players and bots send the same `Command`s).
  `world.ts` (units, combat, waves, structure rules), `map.ts` (layout written for 200 m and scaled by
  `MAP_SIZE / 200`, now 300 m), `abilities.ts`, `inventory.ts` (shop, sell refund window, courier purchases), `courier.ts` (courier movement + delivery), `objectives.ts`
  (runes, Warden boss, wards, glyph, backdoor), `vision.ts` (fog, trees block sight, high ground, day/night),
  `ai/bots.ts` (team plans: farm / push / defend / warden; difficulty easy/normal/hard), `ai/bot-items.ts` (bot item choices from the enemy lineup), `data/*` (all numbers).
- `src/client/` `main.ts` (menus, settings, loop), `renderer.ts` (2D; in 3D mode it draws only the ground
  layer into a texture), `renderer3d.ts` (Three.js view, animations, overlay bars/text, picking),
  `three/hero-anims.ts` (hand-made hero animations: idle, walk,
  attacks, every spell, buffs, deaths), `three/spell-fx.ts` (projectile trails, area spells),
  `three/fx.ts` (dust, sparks, slashes, roots, meteor, whirlpool, camera shake), `three/world-art.ts` (map look: ground detail, flowing river, swaying trees and grass, rocks, walls, fireflies; all decoration, never reacts to units), `three/hero-models.ts` +
  `three/models.ts` (our own models sculpted in code; every model goes through one paint finish when baked into few meshes with animatable joints, so new models match automatically), `menu3d.ts` (start screen 3D hero + portraits), `hud.ts`, `input.ts`, `items-ui.ts`
  (shop), `audio.ts` (loads and plays `public/sfx`), `tutorial.ts`.
- `tests/` vitest. Positions in tests are on the 300 m map. Long full-match tests must `await` a
  `setTimeout(0)` about every 600 ticks, or vitest's worker heartbeat times out on CI (all tests can pass and the run still fails).

## Decisions the owner made (keep them)

- 9 heroes (Brakk, Vexa, Orin, Syl, Grom, Kaela, Morra, Seren, Rhen), 3 abilities each (R = ultimate). **No talents.**
- Owner's rules for the new heroes (2026-11-05): Aegis lasts 3 s. Morra's first spell calls 1 wolf at levels 1-2 and 2 from level 3 (never more). Her ultimate is a 14 s melee Red Wolf form, bigger than her wolves, with extra attack speed, damage, a little crit and move speed; no bear. Feral Bond boosts Morra only when she isn't the wolf.
- Balance goal: no hero is a must-pick (every hero ≈45–55% win rate in random bot lineups);
  team play decides games. Last full check (200 m map): all 45–57%. Needs a re-check on the new map.
- Map 1.5× bigger (300 m). Per lane: tier-1 near the river, tier-2, tier-3 at the gate with **two barracks**
  (melee: tougher, regenerates 5 health a second; ranged), which can only be attacked once that lane's tier-3 falls. A fallen barracks powers up only that creep type of the attackers.
  Shrine towers 11 m from the Shrine. Glyph = invulnerable buildings + 2× tower attack speed.
  Fountain shoots heroes anywhere in its healing area and doorway, never past its wall.
- Controls: joystick moves; tapping the ground does **not** walk (only while holding the minimap, or with a mouse); tap an enemy to attack it.
- Attack (owner's spec, 2026-11-05). Auto attack ON: nearest target in range by itself, also while walking, sticks to it while it stays in range (walking past creeps doesn't switch); an enemy picked with the Attack arrow comes first until it dies or leaves range; never denies, doesn't wake jungle camps. Auto attack OFF: one attack per tap (nearest) or per release of a hold (aimed target); tapping faster than attack speed does nothing extra; holding never attacks until release. Denies are one attack per tap/release in both modes.
- Spells vs obstacles (owner, 2026-11-05): trees, walls, buildings and mountains block only walking, never spells. Charges/dashes go through and may end anywhere: on a mountain, off one, in or out of a pocket, into the Warden's house. Ending inside something moves you to the nearest open spot.
- Mountains (owner, 2026-11-05): six, in the woods between forests, never on a lane or trail (`tests/map.test.ts` checks it), open ground all around so anyone can walk to the foot and plant a ward on top. Not walkable at all: up or down only by blink, teleport or charge. Melee can only hit someone up there from up there.
- Forest: no crowded spots; pockets with no walking way out are on purpose (escape with blink, charge, or a TP brought by courier). Bots are lifted out of pockets and off mountains until they can use them.
- Tower sight (owner, 2026-11-05): towers give the team NO vision; the ground around them stays fog, and lanes are lit only by heroes, creeps and wards. Sight = attack range, blocked by trees: any enemy (invisible or a ward too) in a tower's attack zone with no trees in between is seen by that tower's whole team and shot (wards aren't shot), until they leave. Behind trees the tower attacks only if the team has other vision of them. Attacking a building reveals you for 3 s no matter what. Barracks, Shrine and fountain keep normal team vision.
- True sight: towers, fountain and sentry totems have it and wear a green outlined eye floating on top (never on the ground); the Shrine and barracks do not. A sentry gives vision only for its first 5 s, then only unmasks where the team already sees. Vision is the observer totem's job (24/18 m, 34/26 m on a mountain).
- Lane creeps (owner, 2026-11-11, "exactly like the reference game", from its wiki's Lane Creeps page): closest enemy first (heroes/creeps, then buildings, then wards); being hit doesn't retarget them; a creep on a building/ward switches to any hero or creep in its attack range. An attack ORDER on an enemy hero (tap, Attack arrow, attack button; not auto attack) pulls enemy creeps that have you in acquire range unless another unit is >1 m closer, 3 s cooldown (`pullCreeps`); pulled from out of range: 2.3 s chase; lost in fog: search last seen spot; then back to where it left the lane. Creeps hit seen wards (true sight for invisible ones) with real damage; heroes still 2 hits. No de-aggro, no 5:00 rule (owner said no).
- Morra's wolves need no control: attack what she attacks (any mode, jungle too), turn on whoever hits her, stay within 14 m, don't dive towers or hit buildings by themselves. Non-human units walk around anything blocking them unless there's truly no way (`goingAround` in world.ts).
- Match ending: everything freezes (heroes do not walk), the camera glides to the fallen Shrine, it explodes, result banner, then end screen.
- Menu: Play with Bots, Practice, Play with Friend (locked until multiplayer). Courier art approved: pack mule, winged after 6:00.
- Teleport: hero is frozen while channelling, only the X on the TP slot (or a stun) stops it, no walking cancels it; the X is free, but an enemy stop (stun, root, death) spends the scroll and starts the cooldown like arriving (owner, 2026-11-11); the destination is fixed when it starts, so a tower falling mid-channel doesn't matter. Channel bar over the health bar shows anything charging. Wayfarer Boots: always 1 TP, never used up, 30 s cooldown, allied heroes and creeps as targets too, can't buy scrolls; drop them and you keep 1.
- Battery (owner, 2026-11-06): players decide. Settings has sections; Graphics lists every trade-off (frame rate, sharpness, shadows, shadow updates, world detail, smooth edges) with Low/Medium/High presets (`PRESETS` in renderer3d.ts).
- Mega Creeps when all 6 enemy barracks are down. Camera: default is the farthest, can only zoom in.
- Every hero starts the match with 1 TP scroll.
- Shop: tabs + grid + detail panel with BUY/SELL; taps only select (no accidental buys when scrolling);
  sell = full refund within 10 s, then half; dead heroes can shop; **no quick-buy**.
- Match start: menu has no heroes; **draft inside the match** (1 ban per team, picks 1-2-2-1, then 30 s warm-up).
- Art style: **semi-realistic, darker, painted** (owner loved Sketchfab "Minotaur Berserker" by Yury Misiyuk).
  All models are our own (the trial Sketchfab models were removed for good, 2026-11-03).
  Rejected: cute kits (KayKit, Kenney), Grab3D, Mixamo realistic humans. Models must be free for commercial use
  (CC0 / CC BY, no fan art of other games). Owner's Sketchfab API token is in `~/.sketchfab-token` (never commit it).
- Warden (owner, 2026-11-05): two walled houses on the river, one top and one bottom (`map.houses`), each seen and fought only from inside, slam stun, charm anyone can grab. Starts in a random house. At every dusk it gathers for 4 s (my number) then teleports to the other house, keeping its wounds; a stun in that time stops it until the next dusk (`updateWardenMove` in objectives.ts). After dying it comes back in a random house.
- Map look (2026-11-03): winding river is low ground (level 0) behind stone curbs (`map.cliff`: block walking, not sight),
  with slopes at lanes (no bridges), around runes, at the Warden's house and where trails meet it; normal speed in water.
  Only mid crosses water: the river ENDS at each side lane's inner edge with a slope (side lanes = solid ground, high
  ground over the river). Towers sit 3 m off lane centre (inner side) with a lane bulge; hard-lane T1 near the corner + trail
  behind it; easy-lane T1 (blue bottom, red top) on the OUTER side of the road.
  Trees are individual (`map.trees`): thickets, open woods with walkable gaps, glades; solid forest outside the side
  lanes and around bases. Painted ground in `src/client/map-art.ts`.
- Item names must be our own (renamed 2026-11-03: Watcher Totem, Seer Totem, Herbal Poultice, Mystic Treads;
  "Warden's Charm" stays). Never use "Dota" in anything public (store listing, screenshots, ads).
- Each fountain sits in a walled yard with one doorway toward the centre; the Warden's house walls block sight
  both ways; the Warden returns 8–11 min after dying (random, unannounced); wards die to exactly 2 attacks.
- Courier (owner's design, 2026-11-03): 3 slots per hero, buys away from base go on it, delivers in slot order as many as fit,
  walks lanes only until 6:00 then flies, turns back on death, always invulnerable (owner dropped a killable courier for good, 2026-11-06).
- Player identity (owner, 2026-11-06): permanent random id `ovra-` + 6 letters and numbers (`src/client/profile.ts`), kept on the phone until there's a database to guarantee uniqueness. Display name is edited in Settings → Profile from the start menu only (edit icon → window with Cancel/Save); during a match it's shown with the edit icon disabled. It falls back to the id when empty. Names everywhere (`player-names.ts`): lobby, draft, kill feed, announcements, overhead; scoreboards show `Name (Hero)`. Bots are named by seat (Bot Ash…, my choice). Names are client-only, never in the sim.
- Host taps Start: 3 s ticking clock on every phone, lobby frozen, then the draft.
- Sounds (owner, 2026-11-06): all the same loudness (a sword must not hurt, quiet sounds must be heard). Walking makes no sound for anyone. Nothing electric, everything natural; teleport sounds heavenly. Their reference for the feel is another well known game of the genre, but we never use its files. Music is now wanted in these spots only: match horn at -0:03, a short piece when your hero dies, a short song with the Shrine's explosion at the end. Melee impacts land on the animation's hit frame: `impactAt` in `sound-events.ts` must match the animations.
- Dying costs gold; buyback exists. Android build: not now. App stores: later.

## Open items / next steps

1. **Phone feedback on 3D**: owner checked 0.17.12 (2026-11-11): frame rate, battery, sounds and announcer all fine.
2. **Hard bots (LATER, owner 2026-11-04)**: hard bots win fights (2-5x kills) but only ~half the matches vs easy
   (12 seeds, before and after 2026-11-03 changes): they group-push and leave a lane alone, which gets pushed to the
   barracks; the team plan flips between push and defend and walks across the map. CI test loosened to >=1 win of 3 + 2x kills.
   Also not done: bots using walkways / blinking onto cliff hills, deliberate denies.
3. **Hero balance** on the 300 m map: all 45–55% with the 8 new items (120 matches, 2026-11-05). Bot shopping lists move these numbers a lot:
   adding an item early to a list swung Kaela and Syl by 15-20%. Red ~55% was mostly a biased test shuffle; tick order now alternates. Owner: don't chase it.
4. 3D polish: real art/animations, spell effects in 3D.
5. Living world: shipped in 0.11.0. Phone frame rate and battery with the new art still need the owner's check.
6. More heroes: Morra, Seren and Rhen shipped in 0.13.0. A 4th only if playing them shows a missing role (owner agreed to wait).
   Balance 2026-11-11 (240 matches, before the Vexa nerf): Syl 59.0%, Vexa 58.8%, Grom 51.2%, Brakk 50.9%, Kaela 49.0%, Morra 48.9%, Seren 48.1%, Orin 42.0%, Rhen 39.1%. 0.18.5 cut Vexa's baseDamage 36 -> 33: same 240 matches gave Vexa 54.0% (Syl 53.3%, Rhen 53.6%, Seren 42.0%). Alternative tried: crit mult -0.05 and Arrow Storm dps -10 gave Vexa 47.1%. Single runs swing a lot (Rhen 39% -> 54% with no change): pool runs before tuning. `hero-winrates.ts --json` prints raw totals to pool runs from several cores. Still worth a look: Syl high, Orin/Rhen low in some runs.
7. **Multiplayer.** Local shipped in 0.16.0: `src/net/` (session.ts lockstep + lobby, peer.ts WebRTC via the free public PeerJS service, works from GitHub Pages), `src/client/friend-ui.ts`. Owner's rules: Play with Friend holds Local (host lobby, code, bots fill seats) and Online (locked: invite up to 2 friends, Find Match, 6 humans, no bots). A leaver's hero goes inactive at base in both. Any player pauses (3 per match); dropped players rejoin by replaying the match. Host leaving or locking the phone stops the match (no host migration). Owner tested on iPhones (2026-11-11): a short match worked on Wi-Fi and on mobile data; no full match yet. Not done: TURN relay for strict networks, own introduction service.
8. Later: Capacitor app builds, store release.
9. **Tutorial: shipped in 0.17.10.** `src/client/tutorial.ts`: `LESSONS`, eight short lessons in a quiet match with no enemy heroes; read steps have Next, do steps finish by themselves; rule numbers come from the sim's constants. Check it against any rule change (`tests/tutorial.test.ts` checks topics, length, buttons, and every hero).
10. **Mega Creep armor: approved and shipped in 0.17.10** (`creep(..., mega)` in `three/models.ts`), same size as before.
11. **Hero stats panel: approved and shipped in 0.17.11** (`updateStats` in `hud.ts`). Attack, Defense and Magic columns; nothing already on screen; extras only when you have them.

15. **HUD and screens: the Laurel look shipped in 0.18.0 (owner, 2026-11-11).** Dark iron, polished gold, gold laurel, rubies. Frames are 3D renders: build them in `src/devtools/hud-art.ts` (open `/hud-art.html?v=medallion|ring|clock|panel|plate|slot|mmframe`, `window.hudArt()` gives the PNG) and save to `src/client/hud-art/`. The theme is the "Laurel theme" block at the end of `style.css` (shared frame/plate/button rules cover every screen; new screens must use them). Owner's rule: nothing may overlap anything else, every element keeps its own space. Hero pictures in the top bar are square; your own portrait stays round in its medallion. They rejected flat CSS skins and horns.
16. **Item and spell cards (shipped 0.17.9):** the one layout is in `src/client/describe.ts`: name, mana and cooldown per level (current bold), Stats, then Active/Passive. Item text lives in `use` and `passive` in `items.ts`; stat lines are generated.

12. **Sounds: picked and shipped in 0.17.2 (owner, 2026-11-06).** Their choices are in `scripts/sounds/picks.json`, sources in `docs/SOUND-SOURCES.md`. Silent by their choice: hero deaths, body and tree falls, projectiles landing. One end song for both teams, starting when the camera leaves for the Shrine. `SOUND_NAMES` in `audio.ts` must match `public/sfx` (tested). `Sfx.playHit` measures each sound's hit, so swapping a melee sound keeps it on the hit frame. I can't hear audio.
13. **Announcer: shipped in 0.17.8 (owner, 2026-11-06).** Their 36 ElevenLabs lines are in `public/sfx/voice`, cleaned and leveled by `scripts/sounds/voices.py`; `docs/ANNOUNCER-LINES.md` lists each line and when it plays. `src/client/announcer.ts` holds the queue (no overlaps, most important first, dropped after 10 s) and the under-attack repeat timer (30 s, my number). `warden_fallen` plays on every Warden death for both teams, along with the `wardenDeath` sound. The old sting under kill banners is gone so the voice stands alone. Text toasts stay. I can't hear audio. Before a store release: check their ElevenLabs plan allows commercial use.

14. **Owner's test list (2026-11-06; WRITTEN DOWN, not started, wait for their go).**
    - **Sounds:** all done by 0.17.7, including the orchestral death and buyback sounds and the harp on your own respawn (`respawn` event).
    - **Shipped in 0.17.3:** barracks, melee regen, fountain reach, creeps and the second Shrine tower, removed texts, channel bar margin, dead portrait, ping and shield beside the minimap.
    - **Top bar shipped in 0.17.5** (`updateTopHeroes` in `hud.ts`): Score | P1 P2 P3 | clock | P3 P2 P1 | Score.
    - **Ping and shield buttons:** to the right of the minimap instead of below it, still stacked in a column.

## Gotchas

- iPhone web pages cannot truly hide the status bar: Safari has no fullscreen API on iPhone. Only the Capacitor app can guarantee it. Manifest changes need the home-screen icon re-added.

- Don't `pkill -f <pattern>` where the pattern matches your own shell command (it kills the shell).
- Headless screenshots: Playwright Chromium with `--use-gl=angle --use-angle=swiftshader` renders WebGL
  (slowly; fps numbers there mean nothing).
- Headless screenshots that hang: kill leftover browsers first (`pkill -f chrome-headless-shell`).
- Missing iPhone home-screen icon (Nov 2026): the icon files were fine; an iOS update fixed it. Ask the owner to
  update iOS first before changing icon files.
- iPhone Safari keeps old builds: have the owner reopen the tab and check the build id in Settings.
