# Ovra — Game Design & Technical Plan

> A mobile 3v3 lane-strategy game in the spirit of Dota 2, with original heroes, names and art.

## 1. Decisions so far

| Topic | Decision |
|---|---|
| Platform | **Mobile first** (iOS + Android), released on app stores after testing. Desktop browser is used for development/testing. |
| Orientation | **Always landscape.** If the phone is held upright, the whole game is drawn rotated 90° (`src/client/screen.ts`) and touch input is converted to match. Native builds will also lock orientation to landscape in the Capacitor/Xcode/Android settings. |
| Visuals | **2D top-down now, 3D later.** Game logic is fully separate from rendering so the 2D renderer can be replaced without touching gameplay. |
| Mode | 3v3. Empty slots are filled with bots. Phase 1 is offline (you + 5 bots). |
| Heroes | 3 to start (proposals below, expected to change). Each has 3 abilities; one is always the Ultimate. Abilities can be active or passive. |
| Structure order | Like Dota 2 (see §3). |
| Creeps | Yes. Lane creep waves are core. Neutral jungle camps are planned for the jungle rooms. |

## 2. Technology

- **TypeScript** everywhere, built with **Vite**, tested with **Vitest**.
- **Simulation (`src/sim`)**: pure TypeScript with no DOM or rendering. Fixed 30 Hz tick, seeded RNG, deterministic (covered by a test). Everything a player does is a `Command` (`moveDir`, `moveTo`, `attack`, `attackNearest`, `stop`). Bots issue the same commands as humans.
- **Client (`src/client`)**: renderer (Canvas 2D for now), input (touch joystick + buttons; keyboard/mouse for desktop testing) and HUD (DOM overlay).
- **Mobile packaging (planned):** wrap the web build with **Capacitor** to produce native iOS/Android apps for the App Store and Play Store. `vite.config.ts` already uses a relative base for this.
- **3D (planned):** replace `renderer.ts` with a **Three.js** (or Babylon.js) renderer. World `(x, y)` maps to the 3D ground plane `(x, z)`. Low-poly art keeps it fast on mid-range phones.
- **Online (phase 2):** run the same `src/sim` on a Node server (for example with Colyseus) as the authority. Clients send `Command`s and receive state, with client-side prediction for your own hero.

### Why not Unity / Godot?
Unity is the industry standard for 3D mobile MOBAs and is a valid alternative. It has the best mobile 3D performance and tooling. The trade-offs:
- The TypeScript route lets the same game code run on the client **and** the online server.
- It iterates fastest, can be tested headlessly, and is shareable via a link.

If 3D performance in a Capacitor WebView ever becomes a blocker, the simulation is data-driven and engine-independent, so porting it to Unity C# is mechanical. Re-evaluate at the start of the 3D milestone with a performance test on a low-end Android phone.

## 3. Map

- 200 × 200 m, split diagonally by a river. **Azure** (team 0) owns the bottom-left triangle; **Crimson** (team 1) owns the top-right. The map is point-symmetric, so both sides are identical (enforced by a test).
- **3 lanes:** top (left edge → top edge), mid (diagonal), bottom (bottom edge → right edge).
- **Maze:**
  - **Jungle corridors and rooms:** the space between lanes is forest with jungle corridors and rooms. The rooms hold the jungle camps.
  - **Forest paths:** narrow trails cut through the trees (drawn as faint trails) for hiding, ganking and escaping. Trees on both sides block sight.
- **High ground:**
  - **Ground levels:** normal ground is level 1. Each base sits on a plateau (level 2). There are three ward hills per side (level 3, small raised clearings on the forest paths).
  - **Seeing up:** you can't see ground higher than you're standing on.
  - **Trees** only block you if their tops (their ground level + 1) are at or above your level. So a ward or hero on a hill sees over the normal forest into the paths, but not over the trees around a base.
  - **Uphill attacks:** ranged attacks (heroes, creeps, towers) from lower ground onto higher ground miss 25% of the time (melee attacks never miss), and you need vision up there to keep attacking at all.
  - **Drawing:** plateaus and hills are drawn lighter with dark cliff edges.
- **Per team (Dota-style layout):**
  - each lane: Tier‑1 and Tier‑2 towers, then a Tier‑3 tower with two barracks at the base gate. On each team's **hard lane** the Tier‑1 stands up near the lane's corner (well clear of the river's end) with a forest trail just behind it, so a teammate can come in to help.
  - **Only the mid lane crosses water.** The side lanes are solid ground all the way round their corners: the river ends where it reaches a side lane, with a slope down into it, so heroes on the lane are on high ground and see anyone coming up the river.
  - base: 2 Shrine towers in front of the Shrine
  - Fountain: spawn, healing, very strong defence, invulnerable
  - Towers stand a little off the lane's centre (toward the map's inside); the road bulges out around each one so creeps and heroes pass easily
- **Protection rules** (structures are invulnerable until their turn; shown in-game by a dashed gold ring):
  1. Tier‑1 towers: always attackable.
  2. Tier‑2 tower of a lane: after that lane's Tier‑1 falls. Tier‑3: after Tier‑2.
  2b. Barracks of a lane: after that lane's Tier‑3 falls. A standing melee barracks regenerates 5 health a second.
  3. Both Shrine towers: after **any** barracks of that team falls.
  4. Shrine: after **both** Shrine towers fall. **Destroying the Shrine wins.**
- Losing a barracks makes that creep type of the enemy's creeps in that lane **super creeps** (fixed stats: melee 700 HP / 40 damage, ranged 475 / 44; Mega: 1270 / 100 and 1015 / 86; `POWERED_CREEPS` in `data/units.ts`).

## 4. Units & economy (current numbers, all in `src/sim/data`)

- **Creep waves:** every 30 s per lane: 3 melee + 1 ranged.
- **Towers:**
  - prefer creeps
  - switch to an enemy hero who attacks an allied hero in range
  - 100–140 damage per shot
- **Gold:**
  - 600 at start, plus 2/s passive
  - last hits: 38–48
  - hero kill: 150 + 10 × victim level
  - each destroyed structure pays every enemy hero 120–200
- **XP:** shared among enemy heroes within 30 m. Level cap 15. Ultimate unlocks at level 6.
- **Respawn:** 3 + 1.5 × level seconds.
- **Dying costs gold:** 25 + 2.5% of your net worth, taken only from unspent gold (never items). No loss when a revive charm saves you or when your own side kills you. The respawn banner shows how much you lost.
- **Damage:** armor reduction `1 − 0.06a / (1 + 0.06|a|)`.

## 5. Heroes (proposals, will change)

| Hero | Role | Q | W | R (Ultimate) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Brakk, the Bulwark** | Melee tank / initiator | *Shield Charge*: dash, stun first hero hit | *Iron Hide* (passive): flat damage block, bonus armor below 50% HP | *Earthsplitter*: wind-up, then big AoE damage + stun |
| **Vexa, the Gale Archer** | Ranged carry | *Piercing Arrow*: line skillshot | *Hunter's Rhythm* (passive): every 4th attack crits + speed burst | *Arrow Storm*: 3 s area barrage, damage + slow |
| **Orin, the Emberseer** | Mage / support | *Fireball*: targeted AoE nuke | *Mending Flame*: heal an ally over time | *Cataclysm*: delayed meteor, huge damage + burning ground |

**New heroes (implemented):**

| Hero | Role | Q | W | R (Ultimate) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Syl, the Shadeblade** | Melee assassin | *Shadow Lunge*: leap next to an enemy and strike (80–200) | *Veil*: invisible + 15–30% speed for 3–4.5 s (attacking/casting reveals) | *Execution*: 150–350 + 30–50% of the target's missing health |
| **Grom, the Ironroot** | Melee bruiser | *Root Snare*: after 0.4 s, roots (1.2–2.1 s) and damages (60–180) in a 3 m area | *Bark Skin*: +6–12 armor and 8–20 health regen for 6 s | *Overgrowth*: roots everyone within 9 m (2–3 s), then 40–80 damage per second for 3 s |
| **Kaela, the Tidecaller** | Ranged support | *Tidal Wave*: line wave, 70–190 damage + 30% slow to everyone hit | *Brine Veil*: heal an ally 60–150, +4–10 armor and +15% speed for 5 s | *Maelstrom*: 6 m area for 4 s, 50–110 damage per second, 50% slow |
| **Morra, the Beastcaller** | Summoner | *Call the Pack*: 1 wolf at levels 1 and 2, 2 wolves from level 3, for 22 s. They chase what she attacks, stay within 22 m of her and deal half damage to buildings. A new call replaces the old pack. Their kills count as hers | *Feral Bond*: wolves within 14 m heal 20–44% and hit 20–50% harder and run faster. Morra gets the speed too, but not as the Red Wolf | *Red Wolf*: 14 s as a big red wolf, melee, +45–85% attack speed, +35–85 damage, 10–20% critical chance, +20–30% move speed. Cooldown 75/65/55 s |
| **Seren, the Aegis** | Melee support | *Aegis*: a shield on an ally or herself soaks up 150–400 damage of any kind for 3 s | *Rebuke*: a lance of light through a line, 95–260 damage and a 30–45% slow | *Sanctuary*: a dome with a 6 m radius for 4–6 s; allied heroes inside take 45–65% less damage, enemies inside are 30% slower |
| **Rhen, the Galewalker** | Mobile ranged carry | *Gale Step*: dash up to 7 m straight through enemies, then +25–55% attack speed for 3 s | *Hawk Mark*: an enemy loses 3–9 armor for 5–6 s and can't hide, even by turning invisible | *Bolt Storm*: for 3–4 s, a bolt every 0.28 s at enemies within 11 m (heroes first), 58–102 damage each, while he keeps moving and attacking |

Bots pick random heroes (no duplicates within a team), and every hero has a recommended item build (shown in the shop). Bots themselves plan their items from their role and the enemy lineup (`src/sim/ai/bot-items.ts`): armor (Stoneskin Amulet) against attack-heavy teams, the Warded Cloak against spell- and stun-heavy ones, only one Banner of Valor per team, sentry totems against Syl, and the defensive pick sooner when a hero keeps dying.

Ability levels: basic abilities max level 4 (and at most ⌈hero level / 2⌉), ultimate max level 3 (learnable at levels 6 / 10 / 14). Heroes start with 1 skill point and gain 1 per level up to 15. Levels 16–20 (owner, 2026-11-11) only add stats, no skill points (`LAST_SKILL_POINT_LEVEL`, `MAX_LEVEL` in `constants.ts`).

**Implemented (milestone 3).** Numbers are in `src/sim/data/heroes.ts`; behaviour is in `src/sim/abilities.ts`.

| Ability | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Shield Charge | dash up to 10 m; damages enemies touched; stops at the first hero and stuns it (1–1.6 s) |
| Iron Hide | blocks 10–34 damage per attack (an attack always deals at least 40%); +4–10 armor below 50% HP |
| Earthsplitter | 0.6 s wind-up (Brakk can't act), then 7 m radius damage 200–400 + stun 1.5–2.1 s |
| Piercing Arrow | 18 m line, hits every enemy, 90–270 damage |
| Hunter's Rhythm | every 4th attack ×1.4–2.0 damage and +15–30% move speed for 1.5 s |
| Arrow Storm | 6 m area for 3 s, 70–140 damage per second, 30–40% slow |
| Fireball | homing, explodes for 80–230 in a 3 m radius |
| Mending Flame | heals an ally 120–300 over 4 s |
| Cataclysm | lands after 1.5 s: 250–500 in 5 m, then burning ground 30–60 damage per second for 3 s |

**Rules:**
- Spells ignore armor but can't damage structures.
- Stunned units can't move, attack or cast.
- Unit-target spells walk into range automatically; ground-target spells are capped at max range.

### Draft (implemented)

The start menu no longer shows heroes: you choose lane and bot difficulty, then **Play** opens the draft.
- **Bans:** your team bans one hero (20 s; no ban if time runs out), then the enemy bans one. Banned heroes can't be played by anyone this match.
- **Picks** alternate 1-2-2-1 (Azure, Crimson, Crimson, Azure, Azure, Crimson). Which of your team's three picks is yours is random each match; bots pick the other seats. 30 s per pick (a random hero if time runs out).
- With 9 heroes, the same hero can be on both teams, but only once per team.
- Tapping a hero shows its abilities; the big button bans or locks it in (no accidental picks).
- After the draft: a **30 s warm-up**. The clock counts up from -0:30; no creeps and no passive gold before 0:00 (shop and walk to lane).
- Practice and the tutorial only ask you to pick your hero (no bans, no warm-up).
- Code: `src/sim/draft.ts` (rules, bot choices), `src/client/draft-ui.ts` (screen).

### Mobile ability controls (implemented)
- **Hold the button:** an arrow appears immediately, pointing where a quick-cast would go.
- **Drag in any direction, including behind you,** to aim. The arrow follows. Release to cast; you can miss.
- **Tap without dragging:** casts where the arrow pointed (enemy heroes first; heals go to the most hurt ally, otherwise yourself).
- **Cancel:** release over **✕ Cancel** to abort.
- **Mana cost** is shown on each button.
- **"+" badge:** shown when a skill point can be spent; tap it to learn the ability.
- **Button states:** cooldown seconds, blue when out of mana, dim until learned, dots for the ability's level, dashed border for passives.
- **Desktop:** Q/W/R cast at the cursor, Ctrl+Q/W/R to learn.

## 6. Items (implemented, milestone 4)

**Bottom bar layout:** the hero bar (portrait, health, mana, level, gold) sits just left of the ability buttons; the 2×3 items, TP and shop are to its right; **status icons** are in a row above the health/mana bars.

**Status icons:** every effect on your hero is a small round icon. **Green border = helpful** (yours or from allies: poultice, runes, Mending Flame, Bark Skin, Brine Veil, Veil, immunity, revive charm, Iron Hide while hurt…). **Red border = harmful** (stunned, slowed, standing in Arrow Storm / Maelstrom / burning ground). A dark sweep fills the icon as its time runs out. Tap an icon to see what it is and how long is left. **Counters:** Vexa's Hunter's Rhythm shows how many attacks she has made toward the next critical hit (1, 2, 3; hidden at 0). At **3 the icon glows gold: the next attack is a crit.**

**Inventory and shop:**
- **6 inventory slots in 2 rows of 3, plus a separate Teleport slot.** The TP slot shows how many scrolls you carry, 0 if none. You can buy as many as you like.
- **The 🛒 shop** opens anywhere, but buying and selling only work near your fountain. Selling refunds 50%.
- **Recommended items** for your hero are marked ★ and listed first.
- **Herbal Poultices** stack up to 3 in one slot; tap the slot to use one.
- **While the shop is open,** tapping one of your items sells it.
- **Dropping items:** press and hold an item (or use DROP in the shop) to put it on the ground in front of you. It shows as its icon on the ground with a ring that empties over its **2 minutes**, then it's gone. Tap it to walk over and pick it up. **Only the hero who dropped an item can pick it up again**, so nobody can buy items for a teammate or feed an enemy. Exception: **Watcher and Seer Totems can be handed to allies** (never to enemies); a gifted totem sells for half price. The ring is gold on items you can take, grey otherwise.

**Teleport:**
- 50 gold each.
- Tap the TP slot to open a big map, then tap any friendly building.
- 3 s channel, then you appear on the home side of that building. 60 s cooldown.
- Moving, attacking, casting or being stunned cancels it.
- With 0 scrolls at base, tapping the TP slot buys one.

Item numbers are in `src/sim/data/items.ts`.

| Item | Effect |
|---|---|
| Swift Boots | +move speed |
| Iron Blade | +attack damage |
| Vital Stone | +max HP |
| Mana Crystal | +mana, +mana regen |
| Quick Gloves | +attack speed |
| Guard Plate | +armor |
| Focus Lens | −15% ability cooldowns |
| Arcane Amplifier | +15% ability damage |
| Lifedrinker | attack lifesteal |
| **Crown of Ascension** | upgrades the hero's Ultimate (stronger effect, −30% cooldown) |
| Herbal Poultice | consumable, heal over time |
| Teleport Scroll | own slot, unlimited stack (see above) |

### Legendary items (0.19.0, owner 2026-11-11)

Late gold sinks, each built from two finished items plus a recipe price (shop tab "Legend", gold inner frame on the icon):
Worldbreaker (Siege Maul + Reaper's Edge, 5000), War Standard (Banner of Valor + Mender's Censer, 4500; its aura shares the
`valor` key with the Banner so they don't stack, and also covers allied lane creeps: +15 damage, +50% building damage),
Bulwark of Ages (Titan Heart + Bramble Mail, 4700; button: −50% damage taken for 5 s), Astral Scepter (Archmage Staff +
Soul Chalice, 5500; spells cost 25% less mana), Tempest Blade (Storm Blade + Twin Blades, 5000; lightning hits 4 extra enemies),
Phantom Mantle (Shadow Step + Ghost Shroud, 5000; 15 m blink, then 2 s invisible), Silence Pike (Hush Bell + Sunder Pike,
4500; 9 m / 4 s silence). Numbers are first guesses, not balanced yet.

### Combined items and items with a button (implemented)

Buying a combined item uses up the parts you own, and you pay the difference; the shop shows the reduced price. Bot builds use these items.

| Item | Made from | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Twin Blades (1250) | Iron Blade + Quick Gloves + 350 | +30 damage, +30% attack speed |
| Titan Heart (1400) | 2× Vital Stone + 500 | +650 health, +6 health regen |
| Archmage Staff (2200) | Mana Crystal + Arcane Amplifier + 450 | +450 mana, +3 mana regen, +22% ability damage |
| Warded Cloak (1500) | Guard Plate + Mana Crystal + 550 | +6 armor, +150 mana. **Use:** 4 s immune to abilities (no spell damage, stuns or slows; normal attacks still hurt). 50 s cooldown |
| Shadow Step (1800) | bought directly | **Use:** tap the item, then tap the ground: blink up to 11 m. 12 s cooldown; can't be used for 3 s after taking damage from a hero |

| Sunder Pike (1350) | Iron Blade + Guard Plate + 450 | +25 damage. Attacks lower the target's armor by 5 for 4 s (doesn't stack) |
| Storm Blade (2100) | Iron Blade + Quick Gloves + 1200 | +25 damage, +20% attack speed. 25% chance per attack: 80 spell damage to the target and up to 2 enemies within 7 m of it (not on buildings) |
| Siege Maul (1200) | Iron Blade + 800 | +20 damage. Attacks deal 60% more to buildings |
| Ghost Shroud (1500) | Vital Stone + Quick Gloves + 550 | +150 health, +20% attack speed. **Use:** 5 s invisible and 25% faster; attacking or casting ends it. 35 s cooldown |
| Bramble Mail (1500) | Guard Plate + Vital Stone + 550 | +200 health, +6 armor. Melee attackers take 30% of the damage they deal to you |
| Mender's Censer (1400) | Vital Stone + Mana Crystal + 500 | +150 health, +150 mana, +1 mana regen. **Use:** you and allied heroes within 10 m heal 200. 32 s cooldown |
| Hush Bell (1750) | Mana Crystal + Guard Plate + 800 | +200 mana, +3 armor. **Use:** enemy heroes within 7 m can't cast abilities for 3 s (items still work; spell immunity protects). 30 s cooldown |
| Mire Staff (1300) | Mana Crystal + 850 | +200 mana, +1.5 mana regen. **Use:** tap the item, then an enemy within 9 m: 50 damage and 60% slower for 3.5 s. A tap that finds nobody doesn't use it. 18 s cooldown |

| Wayfarer Boots (2300) | Swift Boots + 1850 | +30% move speed. Always 1 teleport that's never used up, 30 s cooldown, allied heroes and creeps as destinations too; can't buy scrolls while you have them. Drop or sell them and you keep 1 teleport |
| Long Scope (400) | bought directly | +1.5 m attack range (ranged heroes only), +8% attack speed |
| Clearwater Flask (90) | consumable | restores 150 mana over 8 s, stacks to 3 |

Special effects of the same kind don't stack: the best item counts.

Item slots show their cooldown. Bots use Warded Cloak when hurt in a fight and Shadow Step to jump onto heroes.

### Balance pass (match length)

Goal: 15–20 minute matches. Bots-only test matches went from 33–53 min to **20–27 min**; bots defend very consistently, so matches with a human should run shorter.

| Change | Before → after |
|---|---|
| Building health | Tier-1 1800 → 1400, tier-2 2200 → 1700, barracks 2000 → 1500, shrine towers 2600 → 1700, Shrine 4500 → 3000 |
| Building gold for the team | slightly higher (tier-1 140, tier-2 180, shrine towers 220) |
| Creep growth | +30% every 5 min → +12 HP / +1 damage / +1 gold every 7.5 min (0.18.8) |
| Passive gold | 2 → 3 per second |
| XP table | about 15% faster (level 6 around minute 5) |
| Respawn time | 4 + 2×level → 3 + 1.5×level seconds |
| Bots | group up and push from minute 6 when not outnumbered; take the Warden together from ~14 (hard) / 17 (normal) min when healthy and not outnumbered, then check its house again from 8 min after the kill; wait near their tower when outnumbered in lane |

### Hero balance (no hero is a "must pick")

Goal: picking a hero should not make a team stronger; team composition and play should decide matches. Measured with `npx vite-node scripts/map-check.ts [firstSeed] [matches]` (one JSON line per match: winner, length, heroes and items, when each building fell, stuck heroes; run 10 in parallel, e.g. seeds 1000, 1024, … × 24 matches): random 3v3 lineups of normal bots, each hero's win rate across all matches it appeared in.

300 m map check (2026-11-03, 240 matches each):

| Hero | First check | Now |
|---|---|---|
| Grom | 70% | 49% |
| Syl | 59% | 46% |
| Brakk | 55% | 54% |
| Kaela | 55% | 50% |
| Vexa | 40% | 50% |
| Orin | 21% | 51% |

With 240 matches a hero's win rate still swings about ±3–4% from luck. Average bots-only match ~33 min; the Warden is taken about once per match.
Open: **Crimson (red) wins ~55%** in every run (52–58%), also before the bot changes; Azure's hard-lane tier-1 falls first more often. Worth a look at the map.

Changes in this pass:
- **Orin:** more health (660) and mana regen, Fireball every 7 s and harder, stronger Cataclysm and Mending Flame.
- **Grom:** less health per level, Overgrowth smaller (7.5 m) and weaker.
- **Brakk:** less health per level, damage and Iron Hide block. **Syl:** Shadow Lunge a bit weaker, a bit more health.
- **Vexa:** more base damage. **Kaela:** stronger Tidal Wave and Brine Veil.
- Bots now buy items from the enemy lineup (below), which also changed results.

Earlier passes (200 m map): Vexa crits no longer hit buildings, range 10 → 7; Brakk Iron Hide cut; Orin, Kaela, Syl, Grom buffed.

Re-run the script after any hero or item change and keep every hero within about 45–55%.

### Streaks, bounties, announcer, match stats (implemented)

- **First Blood:** the first hero kill of the match pays +100 gold.
- **Multi-kills:** kills within 10 s of each other. **Double Kill**, then **Triple Kill — Team Wipe** (all three enemies in a 3v3).
- **Streaks** (kills without dying): **Hot Streak** (3), **Blazing** (4), **Inferno** (5), **Legendary** (6+). The phrases are original or plain English, not Dota's callouts.
- **Shutdown:** killing a hero on a streak pays 60 gold per kill above 2, up to 400.
- **Announcer:** a big banner in the middle of the screen, and a voice (lines and rules in `docs/ANNOUNCER-LINES.md`).
- **End of match:** a table of every player's level, K/D/A, last hits/denies, gold earned, damage to heroes, damage to buildings, healing and items, with a ★ MVP. It also appears after a surrender, saying who surrendered.

### Pings (implemented)

Tap 📍 under the minimap, pick a ping, then tap the map or the minimap where it should go. Teammates (and bots) see a pulsing marker on the map and minimap, plus a message with a sound. One ping per 1.2 s.

| Ping | What bots do |
|---|---|
| ⚔ Attack / ⛨ Defend / ⚑ Gather | come there (teleporting if far and a building is closer), as long as they have more than 45% health |
| ⟲ Retreat | bots within 35 m fall back down their lane |
| ? Enemy missing | bots stop chasing kills for 10 s |

### Practice mode and tutorial (implemented)

- **Practice:** you alone on the map (creeps and buildings run as normal), with a tool panel: +1 level, +1000 gold, refresh cooldowns/health/mana, spawn a training dummy.
- **Tutorial:** 8 guided steps with a marker and an arrow:
  1. move with the joystick
  2. learn Q
  3. cast it on a dummy
  4. finish the dummy with Attack
  5. buy a Herbal Poultice
  6. hold the minimap to look around
  7. get 2 last hits
  8. how to win

  Each step completes when you do it; "Skip tutorial" ends it.

## 6b. Fog of war, day & night, jungle

**Fog of war:**
- Each team only sees what its heroes, creeps and buildings see.
- Enemies outside vision are hidden on screen and on the minimap, and can't be targeted.
- Bots play by the same rules.
- Buildings are always visible.
- **Trees block sight:** you see the edge of the forest but not through it, so the jungle maze is full of blind corners. Buildings don't block sight.

**Day and night:**
- 3 min day, 2 min night.
- At night hero vision drops from 17 m to 10 m, and the screen darkens.
- The top bar shows ☀ or ☾ and the time until the next change.

**Jungle camps:**
- 3 camps per side, in the jungle rooms. Each has 1 brute and 2 imps.
- They spawn at 0:30 and refill every minute when empty.
- They stay passive until attacked, then the whole camp fights back for 5 s after the last hit.
  - **Chasing:** they chase up to 11 m from home, and wait at that edge if a ranged attacker stands further out.
  - **Healing:** only once they've been left alone at home. This fixed camps (and the Warden) healing up instead of fighting a ranged hero.
- Rewards: gold to the killer, XP to the killer's team.

**Camera:**
- Hold or drag on the minimap to look anywhere; release to snap back to your hero.
- While dead, drag anywhere to look around (for example, to see who needs help).

**Combat feedback:**
- Melee **heroes** show a swing arc, a small lunge and an impact spark (creeps don't, to keep lanes readable).
- Fireball explosions and teleport arrivals flash.

**Movement around buildings:**
- Creeps walk straight while the way is open and path around towers, barracks and trees when it isn't.
- Dashes (Shield Charge) go through buildings.

## 6c. Map objectives & team mechanics (implemented, milestone 5)

Numbers are in `src/sim/constants.ts`, `data/units.ts` and `objectives.ts`.

| Feature | How it works |
|---|---|
| **Denying** | Last-hit your own creeps below 50% HP, or your own towers below 10%. The enemy gets no gold and only 30% of the XP; a denied tower pays the enemy half. Shows a floating "!" and "Denied!". |
| **Totems (wards)** | Watcher Totem (75 gold): invisible, 19 m day / 14 m night vision for 6 min. Seer Totem (50 gold): reveals invisible enemies (totems, invisible heroes) within 10 m. Tap the totem slot, then tap the ground; the hero walks into range (7 m). Totems are always invisible: attacking one needs true sight (a Seer Totem or the fountain), spells don't hurt them and **every totem dies to exactly 2 attacks**. They can't be placed inside the Warden's house. Killing an enemy totem pays gold. |
| **River power-ups** | First at 1:00, then every 2 min, at one of two river junctions. Walk over it to take it. **Haste** (max speed 15 s), **Double Damage** (25 s), **Regeneration** (15 s), **Invisibility** (20 s; attacking or casting reveals you), **Bounty** (gold for you, half for teammates). |
| **The Warden (boss)** | Lives in a **round walled house with one doorway**, on the river between the bottom and middle lanes (the doorway faces the map centre, so both teams are equally far). **The walls block sight both ways**: from outside it is dark (even through the doorway), your team sees inside only while one of its units is in the house, and units inside see nothing outside (bring a teammate or a Watcher Totem outside for that; totems can't be placed inside). **Can only be hurt from inside** (attacks and spells from outside do nothing); it hits anyone. When hurt it fights back, also against anyone else in the house, chases up to **17 m** from home, then gives up and walks home (it heals slowly once left alone). Every **8 s** in a fight it raises its arms (a red circle fills for 0.8 s) and **slams the ground**: 120 damage and a **1.5 s stun** to every hero and creep within 5 m. 14000 HP, 12 armor, 110 damage. Everyone (both teams) is told who killed it and who took the charm. Reward: the **killing blow gets 300 gold**, teammates 150, plus XP. It drops a **Warden's Charm** on the ground that **anyone can pick up, enemies too**. If the holder dies, they get back up on the spot 3 s later and lose no gold (the charm is used up). The charm can't be sold, can be dropped, and **crumbles 5 minutes after the Warden falls** (in a bag or on the ground). The Warden returns a **random 8–11 minutes** after dying, without any announcement, so teams have to go and check. |
| **Fountain yard** | Each fountain stands in a stone-walled yard (just outside its healing area) with **one wide doorway (about 18 m) facing the map centre**. The walls block walking and sight: enemies see inside only through the doorway or once they come in. |
| **Buyback** | While dead: pay 150 + 30×level + 8×minutes gold to respawn now. 5 min cooldown. Button in the respawn banner. |
| **Tower shield** | 🛡 button under the minimap: all your buildings invulnerable for 5 s. Shared team cooldown of 5 min. |
| **Backdoor protection** | Tier-2 towers, barracks, shrine towers and the Shrine take 75% less damage when no enemy creeps are within 18 m, and regenerate for a short while after such a hit. Tier-1 towers are not protected. |

**Sound effects:**
- All sounds are synthesized in code (Web Audio API, `src/client/audio.ts`), so there are no audio files to license.
- Covered: attacks (melee swing, ranged shot, tower), each ability, explosions, deaths, collapsing buildings, gold, level up, teleport, deny, power-up, buyback, tower shield, ward, boss, revive, purchases, UI taps, victory/defeat.
- Your own actions play at full volume; everything else fades with distance from the camera and is silent if your team can't see it.
- 🔊 button to mute; the choice is remembered.

**Kill feed** (top right): every hero death as "Killer ⚔ Victim" in team colours, including deaths to towers, creeps, jungle camps and the Warden. Your own lines are outlined, and the respawn banner says who killed you.

**Announcements:** short toasts for destroyed buildings, the boss, power-ups your team picks up, buybacks, the tower shield and revives.

**Attack controls:** Holding Attack while standing still only **aims** (an arrow at the best target; drag to pick another); nothing is attacked until you let go. On release (or a quick tap) the hero attacks that target and **keeps attacking only it** until it dies, disappears, or you move (also with auto attack off). Holding Attack **while steering** with the joystick (multi-touch) hits the best enemy in range on the move and keeps walking; a quick tap while steering still gets one hit in. Every hero starts the match with **1 teleport scroll**.

**Sound:** on by default. The phone's silent switch mutes it, and so does the Sound setting.

**Settings (⚙, top right):** remembered between games.
- **Auto attack:** idle heroes hit enemies that come into range.
- **Game sound.**
- **Auto-learn abilities:** ultimate first, then whichever of Q/W is lower.
- **Left-handed layout:** joystick on the right, buttons on the left.
- **Vibration** on hits, kills and deaths (Android; iPhones ignore it).
- **Joystick size:** S / M / L.
- **Camera zoom.**

**Pause (⏸):** freezes the game (offline), with Resume and Surrender (tap twice to confirm; the other team wins).

**Scoreboard (tap the top bar):** both teams with level, K/D/A, last hits/denies, net worth, items, respawn timers, and your team's teleports.

**Ability details (long-press an ability):**
- **Shows:** what it does, its values at every level (your current level highlighted), mana, cooldown (after cooldown reduction), range and radius.
- **Long-press doesn't cast:** a quick tap or a drag still does.
- **Passive or unlearned abilities** show their details on a plain tap.

**Damage numbers:** your spell damage (purple), spell damage you take (red), and critical hits (big red "!"). A white frame around a creep's health bar means your next hit kills it, for last-hitting and denying.

**Shop:** tabs (For you, Supplies, Attack, Defense, Magic, Upgrades), an item grid and a detail panel with what the item does, its parts and a BUY button. Tapping an item only selects it, so scrolling never buys by accident. Selling: tap one of your items, then SELL: full refund within 10 s of buying, half price after. Dead heroes can shop (they respawn at the fountain). (Quick-buy was removed.)

**Courier (each hero has one):** 3 courier slots at the right end of the item bar, and a courier button next to the TP slot.
- **Buying away from the shop** puts the item on the courier (also at base when your inventory is full). Buying at the shop puts it straight into your inventory. A teleport scroll bought away takes a courier slot and goes into the TP slot on delivery. When all 3 slots are taken the Buy button says **COURIER FULL** (consumables and scrolls still stack onto their slot).
- **Tap the courier button** to send it: it hands over its items **in slot order, as many as fit** in your 6 slots; leftovers stay on it. Then it goes home. Items bought while it is out wait at the base (dotted slot) and are picked up on its next trip; walking into the shop with the courier at home also gives you its items.
- **Combined items:** parts you already own (inventory or courier) make it cheaper; parts in your inventory are **promised** (chain mark, can't be sold or dropped) and **combine when the courier delivers**.
- **Movement:** for the first **6 minutes** it walks, **only along the lanes** (and inside the base), at 6.5 m/s; from 6:00 it **flies** straight over the trees at 8.5 m/s. It **turns back if you die**. It can't be attacked yet (a killable courier with a bounty comes later). Enemies see it only inside their vision.
- **Slots:** tap a courier slot for its details (SELL anywhere: full refund for 10 s, then half; DROP puts it on the ground where the courier is). **Press and hold** = DROP. **Drag** one slot onto another to swap them; the same works in your 6 inventory slots.
- **Bots** buy along their build wherever they are and send their courier right away; they only walk home to heal.

**Hero stats (tap the portrait ⓘ):**
- **Attack:** damage, attack speed and time, range, lifesteal, spell damage, cooldown reduction.
- **Defense:** armor (with its damage reduction), move speed, health and mana with their regen.
- **Match:** K/D/A, last hits and denies, gold, gold per minute, XP, teleports.

**Visibility rules:**
- **Attacking or casting reveals you for 1.5 s**, even from fog, so ranged creeps and heroes shooting from the dark are seen.
- **Invisible heroes never auto-attack**, so they stay hidden until the player attacks on purpose.

**Assists:** every enemy hero that damaged the victim in the last 12 s gets an assist and some gold.

**Creep growth:** every 7.5 minutes new lane creeps gain +12 HP, +1 damage and +1 gold (super/mega: +19 HP, +2 damage), at most 30 times (`CREEP_UPGRADE` in `data/units.ts`). The old +30% every 5 minutes made late creeps far too tough (owner, 2026-11-11).

## 7. Bots

- Bots use the same commands as players, so a bot slot can later be handed to an online player.
- **Current:**
  - learn abilities (ultimate first)
  - use nukes and stuns on enemy heroes; save ultimates for weakened targets or groups
  - farm creep waves with area spells when mana is high
  - Orin heals hurt allies
  - buy items along a fixed build when at base, always carry a TP, teleport back to their lane after healing, use poultices when hurt
  - only react to enemies they can see; fight back against jungle camps
  - deny their own creeps, grab nearby power-ups, use the tower shield when a tower is about to fall, buy back when the base is under attack; Orin keeps a Watcher Totem and plants it where its lane meets the river
  - lane assignment
  - follow the creep wave
  - last-hit / harass
  - siege only when creeps tank the tower
  - back off from tower fire
  - retreat to the fountain below 30% HP
- **Team plan** (shared by a team's bots, refreshed every 2 s):
  - **Defend:** a building is under attack by heroes, or by several creeps on an inner building. Bots go there, teleporting if they're far away.
  - **Push:** after 10 minutes, when they have more heroes alive, bots group up in the lane with the weakest enemy defenses and push together.
  - **Siege (0.19.0):** from 20 minutes a push becomes a siege: the whole team picks one building (closest to them, weakest on ties; shrine towers and the Shrine too, via mid), teleports near it, gathers 22 m in front of it, waits up to 25 s for a teammate and our creep wave, then goes in together and keeps to that lane until the base falls. Without it, bots couldn't finish matches once late creeps stopped growing fast (`siege` in `ai/bots.ts`).
  - **0.19.1 (smarter bots):** group pushes start at 20 minutes (lanes are held until then). Defending is a side job beside the team plan: only against enemy heroes (the base against any, outer towers against 2+), and only one more bot than there are enemy heroes goes, closest first (a ready teleport counts as close); the rest keep sieging or farming. Defenders stay on guard 6 s (outer) / 15 s (base) after the attackers step away. The Warden only while two enemy heroes are dead. Normal and hard bots last-hit and deny with timing (they predict a creep's health when their hit lands), keep auto attack off while an enemy hero is in their lane so they don't push the wave, and teleport home to heal when far away. Hard bots now beat easy bots in about half the matches (10 of 18, was 0 of 12), with 4x the kills.
  - **Farm:** otherwise each bot keeps its own lane.
- **Gank:** chase a visible enemy hero below 40% health (50% on hard) within 30 m, unless it's under its towers.
- **Difficulty** (picked on the hero-select screen, remembered):

  | | Easy | Normal | Hard |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | Reacts every | 0.6 s | 0.25 s | 0.15 s |
  | Spell aim error | ±3 m | ±1 m | none (leads moving targets) |
  | Uses a spell when it can | 45% | 85% | always |
  | Team plays and ganks | no | yes | yes, more aggressive |

  In test matches hard bots beat easy bots every time (3 of 3).

## 8. Milestones

1. ✅ Project setup, map + maze, camera, touch joystick / click-to-move, pathfinding
2. ✅ Combat, creep waves, towers + protection rules, barracks → super creeps, shrine win condition, basic bots, hero select, HUD, minimap
3. ✅ Abilities for the 3 heroes (data-driven ability system, buffs/debuffs, stuns, slows, projectiles, areas), skill points, mobile aim-and-release casting, bots use abilities, always-landscape
4. ✅ Items, shop, teleport slot, neutral jungle camps, fog of war, day/night, free camera, melee feedback, aimable arrow casting (Fireball is now an aimed shot that can miss)
5. Smarter bots: abilities, items, teamfights, difficulty settings
6. Polish: sound, effects, fog of war, scoreboard, settings, tutorial; **balance target: 15–20 min matches** (an all-bot match currently takes ~30–45 min; items should shorten it)
7. Capacitor packaging, on-device performance tests (low-end Android), test builds via TestFlight / Play internal testing
8. 3D renderer (Three.js), art direction, animations: **on hold until the 2D game is finished**. See [3D-PLAN.md](3D-PLAN.md).
9. Phase 2: online multiplayer (authoritative server, matchmaking, reconnect), accounts

Milestone 5 (done): denying, wards, river power-ups, the Warden boss + revive charm, buyback, tower shield, backdoor protection, sound effects.

**Controls update:**
- **Quick tap:** a tap anywhere (no drag) is a tap-to-move or tap-to-attack, including on the joystick side, so jungle monsters on the left can be tapped.
- **Looking around:** while a finger holds the minimap, the joystick is off and taps on the map move your hero or attack what you tap. Letting go brings the joystick back.

**Item icons:** every item, the teleport scroll and the shop have drawn icons (`src/client/icons.ts`, original artwork) in the item bar, the shop and the scoreboard.

## 8b. Backlog: ideas agreed to revisit

Done or dropped: high ground (done), talents (dropped for now), Android build (not now).

These were proposed and are parked for later:
- **Balance:** bots-only test matches take ~22 min (target 15–20 min with humans); hero win rates are balanced (see Hero balance).

## 9. Things to plan for before the store release

- **Performance budget:** 60 fps rendering, 30 Hz simulation on a mid-range 2021 Android phone; watch draw calls in 3D; battery/thermal limits in long sessions.
- **Mobile UX:** landscape lock, safe areas (notch), large touch targets (≥ 44 pt), pausing on app background (offline only), haptics.
- **Stores:** privacy policy, age rating questionnaires, data-collection disclosures, app icons/screenshots, in-app purchase rules if cosmetics are sold (Apple/Google take a cut and require their billing).
- **Online phase:** cheat prevention through an authoritative server, latency compensation, servers in your players' regions, reconnects, AFK/leaver handling (a bot takes over).
- **Legal/IP:** keep heroes, names, icons and map art original. The genre is fine; copying Dota assets or names is not.
